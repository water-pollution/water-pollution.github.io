					<h2>Clean Water Act</h2>
					<p>
						The modern Clean Water Act has its origins in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments
						of 1972. The basic structure of the act was established at that time, although it was refined
						and refocused by the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1977 (from which it also took its name) and
						by the Water Quality Act Amendments of 1987. The regulatory focus of the CWA is the discharge of
						pollutants to surface waters from “point sources,” principally industrial facilities and
						municipal sewage treatment plants (known under the act as publicly owned treatment works, or
						POTWs). The CWA flatly prohibits any discharge of a pollutant from a point source to surface
						waters unless it is done in conformance with the requirements of the act, and the statute has
						since 1972 retained as an explicit “national goal” the elimination of all point-source
						discharges to surface waters by 1985. Although the “no discharge” goal may never be attainable
						in practical terms, it has helped focus the act's implementation on gradual – but inexorable –
						pollution reduction, as discharge limits are made more stringent over time.
					</p>

					<h2>Water Quality and Sustainability</h2>
					<p>
						Among the general rules established under the Clean Water Act (formally, the 1972 amendments to
						the Federal Water Pollution Control Act), ‘fishable/swimmable’ conditions are to be achieved for
						all of the Nation's waters. Fundamental to such conditions is the maintenance of adequate
						concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Absent consumptive chemical or biological processes, levels
						of oxygen in lakes remain in equilibrium with the essentially constant partial pressure of the
						gas in the atmosphere and concentrations are said to be at saturation. This relationship is
						described by Henry's Law where dissolved oxygen concentrations increase as water temperature
						decreases due to the impact of temperature on the Henry's Law coefficient (equilibrium
						constant). For the range of temperatures typically observed in Great Lakes waters (0–25 °C),
						saturation oxygen concentrations range from approximately 8 to 14 mg l−1. Biological and
						chemical consumption of oxygen in lakes is balanced by reaeration, that is, transfer of the gas
						across the air–water interface. The rate of reaeration increases with temperature, turbulence at
						the air–water interface, and the degree of departure from saturation.

					<h2>Historical Context</h2>
					<p>ECs in the aquatic environment have received global scientific, regulatory, and public attention
						over the past few decades, although the concept is not new and has rapidly evolved over time.
						For example, many towns and cities in the US developed along streams and rivers in the early
						nineteenth century and responded to the newly emergent water-quality issues (primarily
						biological) using the basic sanitation engineering principle of separating drinking-water
						supplies from sewage discharges. Evolution of the urban-water cycle, municipal development, and
						associated water-quality issues are illustrated by the Boulder Creek Watershed, Colorado,
						located in the semiarid western US (Murphy, 2006). Although the area has been used by humans
						since around 14 000 BC (Figure 1), the first permanent white settlers moved to the watershed in
						1858, and the town of Boulder was founded in 1859 (Colorado became a state in 1876). Settlers
						needed water for mining, agriculture, and household use, activities that affected the quality
						and quantity of water. Early residents carried water from Boulder Creek and ditches for
						household use until the first water works was constructed in 1875 to divert water into a
						reservoir upstream of the city. In 1895, the first sewer main was laid, and a sewage settling
						basin and garbage dump was installed on Boulder Creek just downstream of the city.
					</p>

				<div class="col-md-12 align-self-center mt-30">
					<h2>Water Quality Standards Program</h2>
					<p>The framework that came out of the Clean Water Act to be implemented by the EPA and states
						includes states monitoring their water bodies and establishing Water Quality Standards for
						them. Water Quality Standards (WQS) are risk-based requirements which set site-specific
						allowable pollutant levels for individual water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, streams and
						wetlands. States set WQS by designating uses for the water body (e.g., recreation, water supply,
						aquatic life, agriculture) and applying water quality criteria (numeric pollutant concentrations
						and narrative requirements) to protect the designated uses. An antidegradation policy is also
						issued by each state to maintain and protect existing uses and high quality waters.
						<br><br>
						Water bodies that do not meet applicable water quality standards with technology-based controls
						alone are placed on the section 303(d) list of water bodies not meeting standards. Water bodies
						on the 303(d) list require development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). A TMDL is a
						calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet
						WQS. The TMDL is determined after study of the specific properties of the water body and the
						pollutant sources that contribute to the non-compliant status. Generally, the TMDL determines
						load based on a Waste Load Allocation (WLA), Load Allocation (LA), and Margin of Safety (MOS)
						Once the TMDL assessment is completed and the maximum pollutant loading capacity defined, an
						implementation plan is developed that outlines the measures needed to reduce pollutant loading
						to the non-compliant water body, and bring it into compliance. Over 60,000 TMDLs are proposed or
						in development for U.S. waters in the next decade and a half.
						<br><br>
						Following the issuance of a TMDL for a water body, implementation of the requirements involves
						modification to NPDES permits for facilities discharging to the water body to meet the WLA
						allocated to the water body (see Title IV). The development of WQS and TMDL is a complex
						process, both scientifically and legally, and it is a resource-intensive process for state
						agencies.
						<br><br>
						More than half of U.S. stream and river miles continue to violate water quality standards.
						Surveys of lakes, ponds and reservoirs indicated that about 70 percent were impaired (measured
						on a surface area basis), and a little more than 70 percent of the nation's coastlines, and 90
						percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas were also impaired.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 align-self-center mt-30">
					<h2>National Water Quality Inventory</h2>
					<p>The primary mode of informing the quality of water of rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, estuaries,
						coastal waters and wetlands of the U.S. is through the National Water Quality Inventory Report.
						Water quality assessments are conducted pursuant to water quality standards adopted by states
						and other jurisdictions (territories, interstate commissions and tribes). The report is conveyed
						to Congress as a means to inform Congress and the public of compliance with quality standards
						established by states, territories and tribes. The assessments identify water quality
						problems within the states and jurisdictions, list the impaired and threatened water bodies, and
						identify non-point sources that contribute to poor water quality. Every two years states must
						submit reports that describe water quality conditions to EPA with a complete inquiry of social
						and economic costs and benefits of achieving goals of the Act.</p>
