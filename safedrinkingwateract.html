                    <h2>Safe Drinking Water Act</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is the principal federal law in the United States intended to
                        ensure safe drinking water for the public. Pursuant to the act, the Environmental Protection
                        Agency (EPA) is required to set standards for drinking water quality and oversee all states,
                        localities, and water suppliers that implement the standards.<br><br>
                        The SDWA applies to every public water system (PWS) in the United States. There are currently
                        over 148,000 public water systems providing water to almost all Americans at some time in their
                        lives. The Act does not cover private wells (in 2020, 13% of US households were served by
                        private wells).
                    </p>

                <div class="col-md-6 mt-30 align-self-center">
                    <h2>National Primary Drinking Water Regulations</h2>
                    <p>
                        The SDWA requires EPA to establish National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWRs) for
                        contaminants that may cause adverse public health effects.<br>

                        The regulations include both mandatory requirements (Maximum Contaminant Levels, or MCLs; and
                        Treatment Techniques) and nonenforceable health goals (Maximum Contaminant Level Goals, or
                        MCLGs) for each included contaminant. As of 2019 EPA has issued 88 standards for
                        microorganisms, chemicals and radionuclides.<br>

                        For some contaminants, EPA establishes a Treatment Technique (TT) instead of an MCL. TTs are
                        enforceable procedures that drinking water systems must follow in treating their water for a
                        contaminant.<br>

                <div class="col-md-6 align-self-center">
                    <h2>Monitoring, compliance and enforcement</h2>
                    <p>Public water systems are required to regularly monitor their water for contaminants. Water
                        samples must be analyzed using EPA-approved testing methods, by laboratories that are certified
                        by EPA or a state agency.<br><br>
                        A PWS must notify its customers when it violates drinking water regulations or is providing
                        drinking water that may pose a health risk. Such notifications are provided either immediately,
                        as soon as possible (but within 30 days of the violation) or annually, depending on the health
                        risk associated with the violation. Community water systems—those systems that serve the
                        same people throughout the year—must provide an annual "Consumer Confidence Report" to
                        customers. The report identifies contaminants, if any, in the drinking water and explains the
                        potential health impacts.

                    <h2>Protection of Underground Sources of Drinking Water</h2>
                    <p>The SDWA prohibits any underground injection which endangers drinking water sources. The
                        Ninth Circuit United States Court of Appeals while enforcing this prohibition of "harmful
                        injections into drinking water aquifers" explains that underground injection of even clean water
                        can result in the illegal movement of a fluid containing a contaminant into an USDW:<br><br>

                        The SDWA and its implementing regulations are not concerned with whether an injected fluid is
                        itself contaminated. Rather, they are concerned with the result of "injection activity." A
                        permit applicant must show that the proposed activity will not allow "the movement of fluid
                        containing contaminant." Id. Injections of clean water into the ground can cause the
                        movement of contaminants into an aquifer. For example, contaminants may dissolve into clean
                        water as the injected water passes through the soil on its way to an aquifer.<br><br>

                        Underground fluid injection can have disastrous consequences for drinking water and, in turn,
                        for human health. Injected fluid is hard to trace once it enters the ground, and polluted
                        aquifers are hard to remediate. Congress' cautious "preventive" approach requires permit
                        applicants to show that their injections will not harm underground sources of drinking water. It
                        presumes, until an applicant shows otherwise, that injections will contaminate an USDW. Although
                        this approach may result in forbidding some injections that would not contaminate an USDW, it is
                        a valid exercise of Congress' authority.<br><br>

                    <h2>Environmental justice</h2>
                    <p>The SDWA can promote environmental justice by increasing the safety of drinking water in the
                        communities most adversely impacted by water contamination. Communities of color and
                        low-income communities are disproportionately impacted by unsafe drinking water and associated
                        health problems in the United States. Specifically, Native American reservations and
                        communities with dense Latino and African American populations are at higher risk of exposure to
                        drinking water contaminants. Contaminants found in the drinking water of such communities
                        include nitrates, coliform, and lead, which have been linked to cancer, reproductive health
                        problems, gastrointestinal illness, and other health problems. One study found that levels of
                        contaminants in the drinking water of two Nebraska Native American reservations were
                        significantly higher than regional contaminant levels.<br><br>
                        In addressing the updated priorities associated with the act, EPA states that its first priority
                        is to "promote equity... in disadvantaged, small, and environmental justice communities,"
                        specifically addressing that disadvantaged communities face disproportionate risks associated
                        with exposure to contaminated drinking water.<br><br>
                        From an environmental health sciences perspective, it is important to have a clear and workable
                        definition so that questions of environmental justice (or injustice) can be examined empirically
                        by stating hypotheses upfront and then testing them in a rigorous and scientific manner. A
                        practical (testable) definition for environmental justice needs to answer five fundamental
                        questions.<br><br>
                        • How is fairness/equity/justice defined? In terms of procedural fairness or outcome (substantive)
                        fairness, or both?<br><br>

                        •
                        What is the scope of concern? Which sources and hazards over what geospatial scale are included
                        in the analysis?<br><br>

                        •
                        How is unfairness/inequity/injustice characterized? Which deviations from ‘fair/equitable’ are
                        defined as ‘unjust’ or ‘unfair’?<br><br>

                        •
                        Which individuals or groups are the focus of concern? Are there certain individual or group
                        attributes (e.g., race/ethnicity, lower socioeconomic strata) that are shared by those who
                        systematically and involuntarily suffer a disproportionate burden of pollution?<br><br>

                        •
                        What is the likely root cause of unfairness/inequity/injustice? Are disparities caused by
                        intentional discrimination, political expediency, utilitarian policy decisions, or neighborhood
                        transition and other voluntary decisions?</p>
